Before we start writing code, let's ensure you have the necessary tools and set up our project structure.

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: A recent version, specifically **v20.6.0 or higher**. We will use new features like the `--env-file` flag for loading environment variables.
- **A Text Editor**: A code editor like VS Code is highly recommended.
- **An Arkiv Testnet Private Key**: To create entities (write data) on the Arkiv blockchain, you need a wallet. We'll be using the public **Kaolin testnet**, so no real funds are at risk.

If you don't have a private key, you can easily generate a new one by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
node -e "console.log('0x' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

**Important**: Copy the output and save it somewhere safe. Never share your private keys with anyone.

## 2. Project Setup

Now, let's create our project directory and install the required libraries.

<Tabs syncKey="user-os">

<TabItem label="Linux / macOS" icon="terminal" >

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

<Steps>

1. **Create and enter the project folder:**

    ```bash
    mkdir arkiv-dashboard
    cd arkiv-dashboard
    ```

2. **Initialize a Node.js project:** This creates a `package.json` file.

    ```bash
    npm init --init-type=module -y
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:** We need the Arkiv SDK for blockchain interaction and `axios` to fetch data from the CoinGecko API.

    ```bash
    npm install @arkiv-network/sdk axios
    ```

4. **Create project files:** We will need a backend directory for our data-fetching script, and a frontend directory for the dashboard.

    ```bash
    mkdir backend frontend
    touch backend/index.js backend/.env
    touch frontend/index.html frontend/style.css frontend/script.js frontend/charts.js
    ```

5. **Add your private key:** Open the `backend/.env` file and add the private key you generated earlier.

    ```bash
    # backend/.env
    PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
    ```

</Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">

Open PowerShell and run the following commands:

<Steps>

1. **Create and enter the project folder:**

    ```sh
    mkdir arkiv-dashboard
    cd arkiv-dashboard
    ```

2. **Initialize a Node.js project:** This creates a `package.json` file.

    ```sh
    npm init --init-type=module -y
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:** We need the Arkiv SDK for blockchain interaction and `axios` to fetch data from the CoinGecko API.

    ```sh
    npm install @arkiv-network/sdk axios
    ```

4. **Create project files:** We will need a backend directory for our data-fetching script, and a frontend directory for the dashboard.

    ```sh
    mkdir backend, frontend
    New-Item backend\index.js, backend\.env
    New-Item frontend\index.html, frontend\style.css, frontend\script.js, frontend\charts.js
    ```

5. **Add your private key:** Open the `backend/.env` file and add the private key you generated earlier.

    ```bash
    # backend/.env
    PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
    ```

</Steps>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your project structure should now look like this:

<FileTree>

- arkiv-dashboard/
  - backend/
    - .env
    - index.js
  - frontend/
    - index.html
    - charts.js
    - script.js
    - style.css
  - node_modules/
  - package.json
  - package-lock.json

</FileTree>

Your project is now set up and ready. In the next section, we'll build the backend service.
